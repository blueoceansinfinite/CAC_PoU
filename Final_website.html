            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>They say, "If you want to control a habit, just track it." This project chronicles my comprehensive fitness journey from 2016 to 2024. It integrates data from multiple sources to provide a holistic view of physical and mental well-being. I aspired to be a professional badminton player. I embarked on this journey. My coach suggested me to wear a FitBit everyday and track my progress. This habit stayed with me for a long time, even after an injury dispurted my sports careere. I didn't stop wearing my FitBit or exercising. Little did I know it was going to turn out to be so useful. The primary data source for this project is my Fitbit, which tracked workouts, sleep, heart rate, steps, and other fitness metrics. Complementing this, is Digital Wellbeing data which offers insights into technology usage patterns, capturing screen time and its impact on mental health. Additionally, a health tracker app Headspace, which recorded my mood, stress levels, anxiety, depression scores, and other lifestyle factors such as meditation habits and caffeine intake as a daily journal practise. By combining these datasets, this project explores correlations between fitness activities, mental health, and daily habits, visualized through interactive charts and diagrams. The goal is to uncover patterns that reveal how exercise, sleep, and technology use intertwine to shape overall health, providing a data-driven narrative of resilience and personal growth. Looking back at the dates, and the progress I would have never thought that I would be able to make these connections by myself. It was exclusively throguh this project that I am able to reflect on my self.</p>

        <section id="early-beginnings">
            <h2>Early Beginnings (June 2016)</h2>
            <p>In June 2016, I embarked on my professional badminton journey, driven by a desire to represent my country in the Olympics. I remember seeing P.V. Sindhu win her first silver and that was my Eureka moment to start. My days were filled with diverse workouts, from high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to strength training and cycling. On June 12, I tackled a 27-minute HIIT session, burning 540 calories with my heart rate peaking at 133 bpm, feeling happy before the workout but fatigued afterward. This mix of emotions became a recurring theme, reflecting the physical demands and mental rewards of my efforts. My sleep was robust, averaging 7-9 hours, though stress and fatigue occasionally crept in, especially after intense sessions like the 94-minute HIIT workout on June 16, which burned 855 calories and left me energized despite starting happy.</p>

                <p>This Sankey diagram illustrates the relationship between workout types and their intensity levels in 2016, highlighting how HIIT and cycling often aligned with high-intensity efforts, while yoga was more balanced across intensities. The flow visualizes the frequency and connection between exercises like strength training and their high or medium intensity.</p>

            <h2>Building Momentum (July 2016 - December 2016)</h2>
            <p>As summer approached, I changed my routine to include yoga and running with strength and cardio. Around this time, I became interested in professional sports, aiming to be a professional badminton player. I started this journey with my coach's advice to wear a FitBit daily to track my progress.In July 2016, I pushed my limits with a 114-minute cycling session on July 1. I burned 693 calories and felt energized, despite my heart rate hitting 178 bpm. Yoga became essential for balance. A 90-minute session on June 18 helped me manage stress, even though I often felt tired afterwards.My daily calorie intake was around 2000-3000 kcal, which supported my active lifestyle. I also drank 1.9 liters of water each day. By December, I balanced intense running sessions, like 115 minutes on June 27 where I burned 976 calories, with restorative yoga. I maintained a body fat percentage of 28.5% and a VO2 Max of 38.4, showing good cardiovascular fitness.</p>

            <h2>Consistency and Challenges (2017 - 2020)</h2>
            <p>Over the next few years, I stuck to a routine, but data gaps show some inconsistent tracking. When I recorded my workouts, they included cycling, HIIT, and strength training, with some yoga for mental clarity. My mood before workouts often changed between happy and stressed, reflecting life's demands. However, I usually felt an energy boost after exercising. My sleep varied from 4 to 9 hours, which affected recovery. Still, my resting heart rate (50-89 bpm) and steps taken (up to 19,000 daily) showed I was committed to staying active. Calorie burn ranged widely, from 125 calories in a short yoga session to 993 in a 98-minute strength workout in August 2016.</p>

            <p>Over nearly ten years, my fitness journey has been about discipline, adaptability, and growth. I've dealt with mood swings, from stressed to energized, using exercise for mental and physical strength. My steady body fat percentage (28.5%) and VO2 Max (38.4) show stability. Meanwhile, my varied calorie burns (104–994 calories) and distances (0.52–14.84 km) demonstrate versatility. Looking ahead, I want to deepen my yoga practice for stress relief and increase my endurance with longer runs. I'll keep the balance that has defined my journey. This timeline is about more than workouts, it's about becoming a healthier, happier me. I wish I could go back to my old body, I was full of energy, but the stress and anorexia has stolen the fire away. I try to drink enough water and go to the gym everyday. But, somewhere I will have to accept the fact that I can't go back. the way ahead is forward, the sooner I realise it is better.</p>
